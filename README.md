# Description

This is a program that benchmarks the performance of a computer's CPU. Various characteristics are evaluated across four types of tests: Memory Transfer, Memory Access, Integer Operations and Floating Point Operations. Each tests' parameters are customizable (to a certain extent), and at the end of the test, the result is displayed in the form of a graph, plus the result of the most demanding test. The project also has a CPU grading option, which besides the graphs, also gives a grade, and an option to save the charts (mostly used when asking people to run the tests and send back the results). Besides the tests, there is also a CPU Identification function, which displays essential info about the processor.

### Two versions
  I've made this project with QT creator, which has the ability to deploy projects in such a way that no other dependencies are needed to run the project. As such, i've uploaded both the source code and the deployed version for easy use
